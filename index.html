        <p>I'm a software designer and developer in Los Angeles, California.
          My focus is on visual and interaction design for web
          applications and native mobile apps.</p>
        <p>One night during my Sophomore year of undergrad,
          I had trouble finding an app that could tell me
          what to cook with the random ingredients in
          my apartment. Feeling a bit powerless, I decided
          I <strong><i>needed</i></strong> to learn how to design and
          develop digital tools I think people might need/use.</p>
        <p>Adding a minor in Web Development and Design
          helped me get started; years later, I've since been
          able to apply many of the research, design,
          and development skills that felt so foreign
          to me in my kitchen that night.</p>
