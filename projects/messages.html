        Chances are, if you have ever used a messaging application, you have sent a message
        with mistakes and had to resend the corrections with an asterisk at the end (like this*).
        Because most messaging interfaces do not offer the ability to directly edit
        text bubbles, users must begrudgingly clutter their threads with re-sent messages instead.

      <p class="main-paragraph">
        The absence of an edit feature is particularly shocking for Apple’s Messages application
        since users can already interact with texts in multiple other ways.
        This made me curious as to what an edit feature in Messages would look like,
        as well as how it would work, so I decided to create a potential solution.

          <p class="summary-paragraph">
            Since this was not a large project,
            I omitted many steps of the Design Process; I believed doing so would
            also test my ability to design an effective solution with limited time and resources.
            As such, my process consisted of:
            <strong class="emphasized">1. completing a UX audit of the Messages application</strong>,
            <strong class="emphasized">2. sketching my solution and later prototyping it</strong>, and

      <h2 class="section__title">The Solution</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection__title">Step 1: UX Audit</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I began by referencing the Messages interface and how users are
        already able to interact with texts. I wanted to see how Apple could theoretically
        add this feature without their developers having to create new codebases;
        as you will see, my solution is similar procedurally to other message interactions,
        meaning Apple’s engineers would not need to change much of their code to implement this.
      </p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">The Messages Application</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">The Tapback feature clearly indicates to the recipient
            that a message has been interacted with (icon in the corner of the text).
            I considered having an “Edited” icon at the bottom of any message that had been altered.
          </p>
          <p class="process-step__description">Apple also recently added the ability to reply to
            individual texts. Clicking a reply blurs the interface while focusing
            on the original message and its reply thread. I thought something similar could
            be done for edited messages.
          </p>
          <p class="process-step__description">Both features can be accessed by long-pressing
            a single message, so I believed the edit feature should be accessed the same way.</p>
        </div>
        <figure class="process-step__image-container">

        </figure>
      </div>

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="step-2">Step 2: Sketching</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I then moved on to creating low-fidelity solution sketches.
        My main goal here was to quickly generate a visual representation of what I envisioned.
        It was helpful that my ideas were similar to Apple’s existing user interface,
        so I only had to focus on drawing new features/components.</p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">Solution Sketches</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">I sketched three different screens, each one depicting
            a different interaction with edited messages: long-pressing to start editing a message,
            sending an edited message/an edited message thread, and viewing a message's edits.
          </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <h3 class="subsection__title">Step 3: Components and Prototyping</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Prior to prototyping, I thought about how I could
        best represent the concept of “editing” without words/through iconography.
        Ultimately, I decided on a pencil, which can already be found throughout iOS.
      </p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">iOS Pencil Icon</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">The pencil icon is present throughout iOS
            and is typically used to indicate that a new instance of something can be made
            (ex: Mail app, Notes app, Messages app).
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="process-step__image-container">
          <img class="process-step__image-image" src="messages/pencil-icon-ios.png"
            alt="Photo showing different screens throughout iOS that feature the pencil icon.">
          <figcaption class="process-step__image-caption">
            Examples of the pencil icon being used in iOS currently.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">My Pencil Icon</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">I designed a pencil icon almost identical
            to the one found in other places throughout iOS. The icon I created will be inside of
            a circular container like all of the Tapback reactions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="process-step__image-container">
          <img class="process-step__image-image" src="messages/icon-edited.png" alt="Photo of Will's pencil icon.">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Color was important as well. I decided on Apple’s "System Yellow"
        because Apple typically uses that color when something is being altered or created
        (ex: in the Photos app while editing pictures, inside of the Notes application,
        and in the Camera app). In the real world, yellow is often used to denote caution or
        "work in progress."
      </p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">System Yellow</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">System Yellow is found throughout Apple's
            operating systems as indicative of something being edited or created.
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="process-step__image-container">
          <img class="process-step__image-image" src="messages/ios-system-yellow.png"
            alt="Photo showing different screens across iOS that feature the System Yellow color.">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">Edited Text Bubble</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">Using System Yellow for edited messages would
            help differentiate message edits from the original text.
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="process-step__image-container">

            alt="Photo of an yellow, edited text bubble.">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p class="main-paragraph">I then put everything together.
        As aforementioned, the two main actions I focused on were
        <strong class="emphasized">editing a message</strong>
        and <strong class="emphasized">viewing message edits</strong>. I wanted to make sure both processes would
        involve
        similar steps to other message interactions to prevent unnecessarily increasing
        cognitive load.
      </p>

      <p class="main-paragraph">To edit a message, users would simply select the edit feature
        from the long-press dropdown and send their edits as they would a reply.</p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">Editing A Message</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">Showing the original message while
            preparing edits prevents users from making any additional errors
            (by being able to see what was written the first time).
          </p>
          <p class="process-step__description">The yellow "Send" button indicates to users that
            they are about to send a message edit, not a reply.
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="process-step__image-container">

          <img class="process-step__image-image" src="messages/edit-feature-2.png" alt="Photo of a Messages screen with an original message and its edited message in the

            alt="Photo of a Messages screen with a regular, blue message bubble and a yellow, edited message bubble.">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p class="main-paragraph">To view any edits made to a message, users would click on the
        yellow “edited” icon in the bottom left corner of the message
        (like clicking on a tapback response). They would then see the original
        message as well as the edits made to it.</p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">Viewing Message Edits</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">Putting the "edited" indicator at the bottom corner
            of the message separates it from tapback indicators, letting the users know that the
            message received a different kind of interaction.

    </section>
    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="section__title">Feedback</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I tested my solution with
        a few other Messages users and asked for their feedback.
        Generally, the response was positive, but they specifically
        liked:
        <strong class="emphasized">1. using a different color</strong> to delineate message types, and
        <strong class="emphasized">2. preserving the original message</strong> to help compare with
        the edited; keeping the original message could prevent users from
        concealing/erasing negative evidence (trash talking, explicit photos, etc).
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="section__title">Reflecting</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I suppose my next step for this would be to conduct proper
        usability testing with five to six users and consider their feedback before
        implementing new iterations. I would also optimize for accessibility;
        some of my design decisions were rooted in the color of components, but many users may
        not be able to interpret those colors. As such, it would be beneficial to figure out
        how to convey the same ideas without relying on color.
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Overall, this was a great mini project to exercise my user interface
        design skills, as well as some fundamental user experience design concepts.
