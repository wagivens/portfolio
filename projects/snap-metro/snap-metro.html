                As a Design Intern at Snap Inc.,
                I crafted a potential partnership with LA Metro that included a
                Snapchat feature aimed at incentivizing public transit
                usage.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                <span class="emphasized">Early ideas included a Transit Mode displaying
                    transit paths and wait times on Snapchat Maps</span>,
                but I figured existing apps do those things well enough.
                Ultimately,
                <span class="emphasized">I decided the main feature should be a
                    collection of unique, Metro-branded Snapchat
                    lenses users unlock by scanning Snapcodes
                    found at transit stations</span>.

            </div>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                I considered how to ensure users
                get on transit in order to interact with the
                Snap x Metro experiences.
                <span class="emphasized">Snapchat users love gamification
                    and achievement symbols</span> like streaks, so I thought about
                including a Transit Score on people's profiles.
                Scanning a Snapcode and using the Metro-branded
                Snap lenses would increase a user's score; once
                their score reached a certain amount, they could redeem
                various rewards like free Metro passes or trial
                subscriptions to Snapchat Plus.

                        alt="A mockup of a chat screen inside Snapchat. The screen shows the user receiving messages from Team Snapchat about a new feature called Transit Score made in collaboration with Metro. The message says users can use Snapchat to show themselves using transit around LA and receive special rewards from Metro. There is an image of a snap code placed on a wall with a person standing in front of it, and the user is informed about special Snapchat QR codes at transit stations."

                Since LA Metro makes special editions of TAP cards,
                <span class="emphasized">I thought one great way to promote the
                    collaboration and encourage usage of
                    both companies' products would be a
                    Snap-branded TAP pass with a special
                    ghost logo</span>; users who ordered the pass
                would get 300 points added to their Transit Score.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                <span class="emphasized">Snap now often uses their ghost
                    logo as a canvas for theming and
                    messaging, so I did the same by
                    incorporating elements iconic to
                    LA Metro</span>: the Metro “M,” the design of
                the rail station signs, the layout of
                their maps, and the bus signs found on
                street corners across Los Angeles.
