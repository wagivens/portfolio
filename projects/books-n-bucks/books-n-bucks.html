                    School children across the United States are attending
                    classes online. Students, especially young ones, are showing declines in interest, focus, and
                    academic performance; students need ways to stay motivated until in-person classes
                    resume (and beyond). <span class="emphasized">How might we motivate young children stay engaged
                        with school during distanced learning?</span></p>

            <p class="main-paragraph">Books N Bucks is essentially
                <span class="emphasized">a platform for teachers to incentivize students</span>
                during distance learning. When students perform well (arriving on time, completing homework, helping
                classmates, etc), they are awarded points, which can then be used to purchase various items. The product
                owners had an existing site, but wanted us (my university course) to revamp it.
                <span class="emphasized">My team focused on the Student
                    Dashboard only.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Our product owners
                had some <span class="emphasized">non-negotiable features</span>: a store, a section for students to see
                their points, an attendance page, and a section for students to have a reward goal.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Personas">Crafting A Persona</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">We began our Design phase by brainstorming miniature personas for target users.
                <span class="emphasized">We generally agreed the people using the dashboard would be
                    grade-school students, many of whom are in need of positive reinforcement during distance
                    learning.</span>

            <p class="main-paragraph">Considering our personas and target audience, we completed a

            <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Wireframes">Wireframes</h3>

            <p class="main-paragraph">We dot mapped our favorite ideas from everyone's sketches,
                and then we incorporated them into some early wireframes.
                Our designs focused on card-like elements and large content to appeal
                to young children
                without overwhelming or confusing them. We met the product owners' requirements,
                and we found ways to enhance what they wanted.

            <p class="main-paragraph">We believed:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-item">The points and reward goal should be front-and-center,
                    motivating students each time they log in.
                </li>
                <li class="list-item">Students should be able to see
                    their points history and why they were given them (making them more likely to repeat those actions
                    in
                    the future).
                </li>
                <li class="list-item">Students should be able to save
                    Store items and set them as their reward goal right from a wishlist.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="main-paragraph">For the Store page, I suggested using various colors and copy for the
                purchase state of an item to differentiate between lack of points and out-of-stock.

            <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Wireframe Testing">Testing Our Wireframes</h3>

            <p class="main-paragraph">We then
                <span class="emphasized">tested our wireframes over Zoom with 3 students</span>
                at an LAUSD school that was already using Books N Bucks. We noticed:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-item">Students enjoyed seeing their points and reward goal on the Home page.
                </li>
                <li class="list-item">Being able to save Store items to a wishlist was preferable to searching for it
                    again in the Store.
                </li>
                <li class="list-item">Iconography on the Attendance page was confusing.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Prototyping">Final Prototypes</h3>

            <p class="main-paragraph">Prototyping and putting together final designs was our next step. The product
                owners had their own color scheme of red, white, and black, so we adhered to those design guidelines. We
                decided to use Montserrat as our primary font because it is simple but slightly playful. We also added
                pagination to multiple pages to prevent overloading students with information and choices.
            </p>

            <div class="figure-container half-width">
                <figure>

                        alt="Home page showing the student's points, goal, and the weather.">

            </div>

            <p class="main-paragraph">I was responsible for incorporating feedback into the Attendance page design.
                Since our testing participants told us the iconography was confusing, I decided we should switch to
                colored badge elements; coloring them helps convey status, but
                <span class="emphasized">using words instead of icons
                    makes it accessible for those who can't interpret the colors.</span>
            </p>

            <div class="figure-container half-width">
                <figure>
                    <img src="./final-mockup-attendance.png"
                        alt="Attendance page showing colored badges that represent attendance status for each class.">
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="main-paragraph">We tested the final prototypes as well with 3 more LAUSD students. We received
                no negative feedback, so we were confident that we addressed all of the concerns from our wireframe
                testing. From there, we moved on to developing the front and back ends of the dashboard.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Development">Development</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">The front-end was a combination of React and SCSS, and we developed the front-end
                over the course of 2 weeks. As with the prototypes, I was mostly responsible for implementing the
                Attendance page. The back-end was done using Google Firebase and Google Cloud Functions, and was
                developed over the course of 2 weeks as well.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">I implemented a function that would retrieve information about a user's reward
                goal (such as the image and cost) from the database. Here is an image of the code:
