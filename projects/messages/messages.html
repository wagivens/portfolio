      <p class="main-paragraph">
        The absence of an edit feature is surprising for Apple’s Messages application
        since users can already interact with texts in multiple other ways.
        This made me curious as to what an edit feature in Messages would look like,
        as well as how it would work.

      <article class="problem-statement">
        <p class="problem-statement__text black"><strong>Problem:</strong>
          Due to a lack of proper message editing functionality,
          Messages users are often forced

          <p class="summary-paragraph">
            I designed a message editing feature for Apple's Messages application.
            My process consisted of:
            <strong class="emphasized">1. completing a UX audit of the Messages application</strong>,
            <strong class="emphasized">2. sketching my solution and later prototyping it</strong>, and

      <h2 class="section__title">The Solution</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="UX Audit">Step 1: UX Audit</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I began by referencing the Messages interface and how users are
        already able to interact with texts. I wanted to see how Apple could theoretically
        add this feature without their developers having to create new codebases;
        as you will see, my solution is similar procedurally to other message interactions,
        meaning Apple’s engineers would not need to change much of their code to implement this.
      </p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">The Messages Application</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">The Tapback feature signals
            that a message has been seen and reacted to. I considered having an “Edited” icon
            at the bottom of any message that had been altered.
          </p>
          <p class="process-step__description">Clicking a message reply blurs the interface while focusing
            on the original message and its reply thread. I thought something similar could
            be done for edited messages.
          </p>
          <p class="process-step__description">Both features are accessed by long-pressing
            a single message, so I believed the edit feature should be accessed the same way.</p>
        </div>
        <figure class="process-step__image-container">
          <img class="process-step__image-image" src="./apple-messages-1.png"

            Examples of existing message interactions in Messages.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Sketching">Step 2: Sketching</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I then moved on to creating low-fidelity solution sketches.
        It was helpful that my ideas were similar to Apple’s existing user interface,
        so I only had to focus on drawing a few new features/components.</p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">Solution Sketches</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">I sketched three different screens:
            long-pressing to start editing a
            message, sending message edits, and viewing a message's edits.
          </p>

            Sketches of my solution.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Prototyping">Step 3: Components and Prototyping</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Prior to prototyping, I thought about how I could
        best represent the concept of “editing” without words.
        I believed a pencil icon would work perfectly.
      </p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">iOS Pencil Icon</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">The pencil icon is already present throughout iOS
            and is typically used to indicate that a new instance of something can be made
            (ex: Mail app, Notes app, Messages app).
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="process-step__image-container">
          <img class="process-step__image-image" src="./pencil-icon-ios.png"
            alt="Examples of the pencil icon in the iOS Mail, Notes, and Messages apps.">
          <figcaption class="process-step__image-caption">
            Examples of the pencil icon being used in iOS currently.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">My Pencil Icon</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">I designed a pencil icon almost identical
            to the one found in other places throughout iOS. The icon I created would be inside of
            a circular container like all of the Tapback reactions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="process-step__image-container">
          <img class="process-step__image-image" src="./icon-edited.png" alt="Will's pencil icon.">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Color was important as well.
        I tried to figure out which color(s) would best signify that a component had been
        changed or was being worked on. Ultimately, I decided on Apple’s “System Yellow.”
      </p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">System Yellow</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">Apple uses System Yellow when
            something is being altered or created
            (ex: in the Photos app while editing pictures,
            inside of the Notes application, and in the Camera app).
            In the real world, yellow is often used to denote caution or "work in progress."
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="process-step__image-container">
          <img class="process-step__image-image" src="./ios-system-yellow.png"
            alt="Examples of different screens across iOS that feature the System Yellow color.">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">Edited Text Bubble</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">Using System Yellow for edited messages would
            help differentiate edited messages from original texts.
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="process-step__image-container">
          <img class="process-step__image-image" src="./bubble-edited.png"
            alt="Yellow text bubble saying 'They should've made that a feature a long time ago.'">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p class="main-paragraph">I then put everything together.
        As aforementioned, the two main actions I focused on were
        <strong class="emphasized">editing a message</strong>
        and <strong class="emphasized">viewing message edits</strong>. I made sure both processes
        involved
        similar steps to other message interactions to prevent unnecessarily increasing
        cognitive load.
      </p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">Editing A Message</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">To edit a message, users would select the edit feature
            from the long-press dropdown and send their edits as they would a reply.</p>

          <p class="process-step__description">Showing the original message while
            preparing edits prevents users from making any additional errors
            (by being able to see what was written the first time).
          </p>
          <p class="process-step__description">Making the "Send" button yellow tells users that
            they are about to edit a message, not reply to it.
          </p>

      <div class="process-step flex-row">

          <h4 class="process-step__title">Viewing Message Edits</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">To view edits made to a message, users would click on the
            yellow “edited” icon in the bottom left corner of the message
            (like clicking on a tapback response). They would then see the original
            message as well as the edits made to it.</p>
          <p class="process-step__description">Putting the "edited" indicator in the bottom corner
            lets users know it is something different than the Tapback reactions.

      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="section__title" id="Testing">Feedback</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I tested my solution with
        a few other Messages users and asked for their feedback.
        Generally, the response was positive, but they specifically
        liked:
        <strong class="emphasized">1. using a different color</strong> to delineate message types, and
        <strong class="emphasized">2. preserving the original message</strong> to help compare with
        the edited; keeping the original message would prevent users from
        concealing/erasing negative evidence (trash talking, explicit photos, etc).
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="section__title" id="Reflection">Reflecting</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">One of my next steps for this would be to optimize for accessibility.
        Some of my design decisions were rooted in the color of components, but many users may
        not be able to interpret them. As such, it would be beneficial to figure out
        how to convey the same ideas without relying on color.
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Overall, this was a great mini project to exercise my user interface
        design skills, as well as some fundamental user experience design concepts.
