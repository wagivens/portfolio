      <p class="main-paragraph">
        It is surprising that Apple's Messages application has no edit feature
        since users can already interact with texts in multiple ways.
        The absence of an edit feature means users sometimes resend messages with corrections,
        cluttering their text threads.
        This made me curious as to what an edit feature in Messages would look like.

    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="subsection__title">Starting Where We Are</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">
        In referencing the existing Messages interface,
        I noticed the "Tapback" feature uses a corner icon to clearly indicate
        a message was interacted with.
        I considered having a unique icon at the bottom of any message that was edited.
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">
        Moreover, clicking a message reply blurs the interface while focusing
        on the original message and its reply thread. I thought something
        similar could be done for edited messages; essentially, an “edits” thread.
      </p>
      <div class="figure-container half-width">
        <figure>
          <img src="./highlight-messages-app.png" alt="Two separate Messages screens. The first screen shows a message
          with the tapback icons above it. The second screen shows a message reply thread
          with the background blurred.">
          <figcaption>
            <span class="figcap-title">The Messages Application.</span>
            You can see how a tapback icon is a helpful indicator, and how
            the interface is blurred when reading a message's replies thread.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p class="main-paragraph">
        In general, I figured modeling the edit feature after existing
        ones would make it both technically feasible for Apple's software engineers,
        as well as familiar for Messages users.

      <h2 class="subsection__title">Thinking Through the Solution</h2>

      <!-- Iconography and Color -->
      <p class="main-paragraph">
        I first thought about which icon(s) would best represent the concept
        of editing and ultimately decided on a pencil, which can already be found
        throughout iOS; it is typically used to indicate a user can
        change or create a text-based component (ex: altering a note in the Notes application,
        creating a new text message thread, writing a new email, etc).
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">
        Color was also important. I determined Apple's “System Yellow” would
        best signify a component had been changed or was being worked on.
        Apple often uses System Yellow when something is being altered
        (ex: editing pictures in the Photos app, changing settings in the Camera app, etc).
        In the physical world, yellow is sometimes used for alerts or to denote "work in progress."
      </p>
      <div class="figure-container half-width">
        <figure>
          <img src="./system-yellow-in-iOS.png" alt="An image with three separate iPhone screens to demonstrate
          System Yellow throughout iOS. The first screen shows a recording
          being edited in the Voice Memos app. The second screen shows image settings
          in the Camera app. The third screen shows a photo being edited in the Photos app.">
          <figcaption>
            <span class="figcap-title">System Yellow in iOS.</span>
            System Yellow is used throughout iOS, typically when something
            is being edited.

            <img src="./highlight-system-yellow.png" alt="Image with three separate components that 
            have a background color of
            System Yellow. The three components are a pencil icon with a yellow background,
            a text bubble with a yellow background, and the 'send message' button with
            a yellow background.">
          </picture>
          <figcaption>
            <span class="figcap-title">Utilizing System Yellow.</span>
            I decided most of the elements associated with message editing should
            be yellow. This included the "edited" icon, the actual edited message,
            and even the button used to send a message edit.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <!-- Sketching the Solution -->
      <p class="main-paragraph">
        I drew some rudimentary sketches to help envision how
        the feature would work:
      </p>
      <div class="figure-container half-width">
        <figure>
          <img src="./highlight-sketches.png" alt="Three sketches of three independent iPhone screens. 
          First sketch shows
          the message tapback options and long-press menu. Second shows a button that says
          'view message edits,' and the third shows an original message with its edited 
          message in yellow.">
          <figcaption>
            <span class="figcap-title">My Sketches.</span>
            These quick sketches allowed me to visualize the flow of editing a message.

    <!-- Prototyping -->
    <section class="case-study__section" id="Prototyping">
      <h2 class="subsection__title">Prototyping</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I then put everything together.
        Using an iOS UI kit on Figma, I prototyped what I believed
        were the two most important user flows:
        <strong class="emphasized">editing a message</strong>
        and <strong class="emphasized">viewing message edits</strong>.
      </p>
      <div class="figure-container">
        <figure>
          <picture>
            <source media="(max-width: 749px)" srcset="./highlight-editing-message-vertical.png">
            <source media="(min-width: 750px)" srcset="./highlight-editing-message.png">
            <img src="./highlight-editing-message.png" alt="Three iPhone screens. 
            First screen shows a long-press menu with 'edit' as one of the options.
            The second shows a message edit about to be sent. The third shows the edited message thread
            with the original message and its edited message in yellow.">
          </picture>
          <figcaption>
            <span class="figcap-title">Editing a Message.</span>
            Editing a message is very similar to replying to one: a user taps the message,
            writes an edited response, and sends it. Easy.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div class="figure-container">
        <figure>
          <picture>
            <source media="(max-width: 749px)" srcset="./highlight-view-edits-vertical.png">
            <source media="(min-width: 750px)" srcset="./highlight-view-edits.png">
            <img src="./highlight-view-edits.png" alt="Three iPhone screens. 
            First screen shows a message with an 'edited' icon,
            the second has a button that says 'view message edits,' and the third shows
            a thread with an original message and its edited message in yellow.">
          </picture>
          <figcaption>
            <span class="figcap-title">Viewing Message Edits.</span>
            Viewing edits made to a message is nearly identical to opening a message's reply thread.
            This familiarity is key for reducing the cognitive load of the feature.

    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="subsection__title" id="Reflection">Reflecting</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">One of my next steps for this would be to optimize for accessibility.
        Some of my design decisions were rooted in the color of components, but many users may
        not be able to interpret them. As such, it would be beneficial to figure out
        how to convey the same ideas without relying on color.
