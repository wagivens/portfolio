          Young adults are often confused about which products to recycle and
          how to recycle them due to the wide range of recyclable materials
          and recycling parameters. As such, recyclable waste ends up in landfills
          instead of recycling centers. </p>

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Defining">Defining the Product</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I began by referencing the Messages interface and how users are
        already able to interact with texts. I wanted to see how Apple could theoretically
        add this feature without their developers having to create new codebases;
        as you will see, my solution is similar procedurally to other message interactions,
        meaning Apple’s engineers would not need to change much of their code to implement this.

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Empathizing">Empathizing With Target Users</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I then moved on to creating low-fidelity solution sketches.
        It was helpful that my ideas were similar to Apple’s existing user interface,
        so I only had to focus on drawing a few new features/components.</p>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Color was important as well.
        I tried to figure out which color(s) would best signify that a component had been
        changed or was being worked on. Ultimately, I decided on Apple’s “System Yellow.”
      </p>

      <!-- Design System Here -->
      <div class="process-step flex-row">
        <div class="process-step__info">
          <h4 class="process-step__title">System Yellow</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">Apple uses System Yellow when
            something is being altered or created
            (ex: in the Photos app while editing pictures,
            inside of the Notes application, and in the Camera app).
            In the real world, yellow is often used to denote caution or "work in progress."

        <figure class="process-step__image-container">

            alt="Photo showing different screens across iOS that feature the System Yellow color.">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p class="main-paragraph">I then put everything together.
        As aforementioned, the two main actions I focused on were
        <strong class="emphasized">editing a message</strong>
        and <strong class="emphasized">viewing message edits</strong>. I made sure both processes
        involved
        similar steps to other message interactions to prevent unnecessarily increasing
        cognitive load.

          <h4 class="process-step__title">Editing A Message</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">To edit a message, users would select the edit feature
            from the long-press dropdown and send their edits as they would a reply.</p>

          <p class="process-step__description">Showing the original message while
            preparing edits prevents users from making any additional errors
            (by being able to see what was written the first time).

          <p class="process-step__description">Making the "Send" button yellow tells users that
            they are about to edit a message, not reply to it.

      <h2 class="section__title" id="Testing">Feedback</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I tested my solution with
        a few other Messages users and asked for their feedback.
        Generally, the response was positive, but they specifically
        liked:
        <strong class="emphasized">1. using a different color</strong> to delineate message types, and
        <strong class="emphasized">2. preserving the original message</strong> to help compare with
        the edited; keeping the original message would prevent users from
        concealing/erasing negative evidence (trash talking, explicit photos, etc).

    </section>
    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="section__title" id="Reflection">Reflecting</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">One of my next steps for this would be to optimize for accessibility.
        Some of my design decisions were rooted in the color of components, but many users may
        not be able to interpret them. As such, it would be beneficial to figure out
        how to convey the same ideas without relying on color.
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Overall, this was a great mini project to exercise my user interface
        design skills, as well as some fundamental user experience design concepts.
