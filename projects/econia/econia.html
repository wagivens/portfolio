        Living sustainably is becoming increasingly important as the effects of climate change become more apparent.
        Young adults enjoy trying to live green, particularly by recycling, but the process can be confusing and the
        benefits are not always clear. This prompted a team of myself and 4 others, as part of a university
        course, to remedy those issues with a new digital product: Econia.

        <p class="problem-statement__text"><span class="emphasized">Problem:</span>
          Young adults are often confused about which products to recycle and
          how to recycle them due to the wide range of recyclable materials
          and recycling parameters. As such, recyclable waste ends up in landfills
          instead of recycling centers. </p>

      <h2 class="section__title">The Original Solution</h2>

      <p class="main-paragraph">My team and I utilized the Design Thinking Framework
        throughout the course of one semester to create a mobile application that would
        simultaneously educate users and incentivize them to recycle.</p>

      <!-- Defining -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Defining">Defining the Product</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">We began with a
        <span class="emphasized">competitive analysis</span>
        on recycling apps and sites. By comparing the features, strengths, and weaknesses of different products, we
        discovered that many recycling apps/sites are
        great at educating users and providing local resources, as well as having
        enjoyable user experiences. However, they are purely educational and lack
        incentives to motivate users to apply their recycling knowledge.
      </p>
      <div class="figure-container half-width">

          <img src="./highlight-competitive-analysis.png" alt="Competitive matrix that was used to analyze the market.">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <!-- Empathizing -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Empathizing">Empathizing With Target Users</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">We then moved on to gaining an understanding of our target users.
        We believed a <span class="emphasized">user survey</span>
        coupled with
        <span class="emphasized">five interviews</span> would give us the best insights.
      </p>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Then, we analyzed the 70 responses we received on our survey:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">71% of respondents reported
          feeling positive towards recycling,
          but only 28% felt like their knowledge of recycling was extensive.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">92% reported receiving no compensation for
          recycling, and a majority (69%) said they would recycle more if they
          received something in return.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">Over half (57%) said they never pay attention to
          codes on products when recycling.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Our interviews taught us that
        young adults are:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">Often influenced by
          peer pressure to recycle more.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">Enthusiastic about
          sustainable/reusable alternatives to products they commonly recycle.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">Interested in lifestyle apps they can easily integrate
          into their daily routines.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Using our competitive analysis and research, we decided it was
        imperative for our product to further
        <span class="emphasized">educate users on recyclable products and the recycling process</span>.
        We would also need to
        <span class="emphasized">provide healthy peer pressure and relevant incentives</span> for participating.
      </p>

      <p class="main-paragraph">
        From there, we completed
        <span class="emphasized">empathy maps</span> for our two main types of users.
        Our primary user was a young adult who greatly favors recycling but believes the process
        is not streamlined enough. Our secondary user felt indifferent towards recycling
        but does it out of convenience and peer pressure.

        </figure>
      </div>

      <!-- Ideating -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Ideating">Ideating Potential Solutions</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Our ideation process started with us proposing
        <span class="emphasized">"How Might We?"</span>
        questions and dot-voting which themes we felt best about. Our most popular ones revolved around educating users,
        providing incentives, and integrating easily into users' lives, so we decided to primarily focus on those.

        </figure>
      </div>

      <p class="main-paragraph">From there, we conducted a <span class="emphasized">Crazy 8s</span> sketching session
        and
        dot-voted those as well. Here are some of my early explorations of the application:

      </div>


      <!-- Prototyping -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Prototyping">Prototyping Final Solutions</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Before prototyping, we constructed a sitemap and
        wireframes of our application.
      </p>
      <div class="figure-container half-width">
        <figure>
          <img src="./wireframes-1.png" alt="Photos of wireframes for the Login and Scanning pages.">

        <figure>
          <img src="./wireframes-2.png" alt="Photos of wireframes for the Recycling and Profile pages.">

          <img src="./wireframes-3.png" alt="Photos of wireframes for the Rewards page.">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Then, we put everything together to create our high-fidelity prototypes.
        Here is a brief breakdown of the key features:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">The Home screen presents users with a list of other people's
          recycling activity to promote healthy peer pressure.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">People would start the recycling process by
          scanning a recyclable item, after which they could save it to their list to
          recycle later (if they couldn't in the moment) or locate nearby bins to deposit the item.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">To successfully complete a “recycle”,
          people are given a map of nearby recycling bins. Upon arriving, they scan a
          QR code (letting us know the item deposit was legitimate) and are then awarded points.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">Econia's Profile page shows users their points and suggests
          sustainable alternatives to products they recycle often (ex: water bottles).
          The Rewards page offers prizes relevant to our target audience,
          which users can buy with their recycling points.
        </li>
      </ul>

        </figure>
      </div>

      <!-- Testing -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Testing">Testing Our Solutions</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">We conducted 5 <span class="emphasized">usability tests</span> through observation
          and interviewing, which ultimately taught us:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li class="list-item">
            <span class="emphasized">Clear iconography</span> is important.
            3 of our participants thought our icons were confusing.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            <span class="emphasized">User onboarding</span> can be valuable.
            Some interviewees expressed they would have been more comfortable
            navigating the application if they completed onboarding first.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            The Rewards section of our app was well-received,
            as were the educational tips and recyclable product recommendations.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- My Redesign -->
    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="section__title" id="Redesign">My Redesign</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Since Econia was never intended to go into production, I decided to
        redesign it independently to see how I could improve it. I made many
        purely aesthetic modifications, but I based most other refinements
        on the experience as a whole.
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">One change was
        <span class="emphasized">placing the user's points at the top</span>,
        making it always visible instead of only accessible on the
        Profile and Rewards pages. I also
        <span class="emphasized">moved the nav bar to the
          bottom of the screen</span> both for better ergonomics and to be more consistent with
        other applications (we, as users, are familiar with nav bars being at the bottom).
      </p>
      <div class="figure-container half-width">
        <figure>
          <img src="./redesign-flow-profile.png" alt="Mockups of the re-designed Profile page.">
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p class="main-paragraph">I made the
        <span class="emphasized">home screen more of a leaderboard</span>instead of
        a constant stream of activity from nearby users; the folks using
        the app likely would only want to see a total number of points, not
        every recycle another user is making. Additionally, I
        <span class="emphasized">refined the visual design of the List page</span>
        while retaining the ability for users to
        learn more about what they are recycling.
