          Young adults are often confused about which products to recycle and
          how to recycle them due to the wide range of recyclable materials
          and recycling parameters. As such, recyclable waste ends up in landfills
          instead of recycling centers. </p>

      <p class="main-paragraph">My team and I utilized the Design Thinking Framework
        throughout the course of one semester to create a mobile application that would
        simultaneously educate users and incentivize them to recycle.
        As such, our process involved:</p>

        <li class="list-item">Testing Final Designs for Usability</li>
      </ol>

      <!-- Defining -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Defining">Defining the Product</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">To begin, our team conducted a
        <span class="emphasized">competitive analysis</span>
        on recycling apps and sites. We discovered that existing products are
        great at educating users and providing local resources, as well as having
        enjoyable user experiences. However, they are purely educational and lack
        incentives to motivate users to apply their recycling knowledge.
      </p>

      <!-- Empathizing -->
      <!-- Include: 
        5. Journey Map
      -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Empathizing">Empathizing With Target Users</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">We then moved on to gaining an understanding of our target users.
        We believed a <span class="emphasized">user survey</span>
        coupled with
        <span class="emphasized">5 interviews</span> would give us the best insights.
      </p>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Our survey revealed:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">71% of respondents reported
          having a very positive attitude towards recycling,
          but only 28% felt like their knowledge of recycling was extensive.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">92% reported receiving no compensation for
          recycling, but a majority (69%) said they would recycle more if they
          received something in return.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">Over half (57%) said they never pay attention to
          codes on products when recycling.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Our one-on-one interviews taught us that
        young adults are:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">Often influenced by
          peer pressure to recycle more.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">Enthusiastic about
          sustainable/reusable alternatives to products they commonly recycle.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">Interested in lifestyle apps that help them with
          their daily routines.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Using our competitive analysis and research, we decided it was
        imperative for our product to further educate users on recyclable products and the recycling process.
        We would also need to provide healthy peer pressure and relevant incentives for participating.
      </p>

      <p class="main-paragraph">
        From there, we completed
        <span class="emphasized">empathy maps</span> and
        <span class="emphasized">personas</span> for our 2 main types of users.
        Our primary user was a young adult who greatly favors recycling but believes the process
        is not streamlined enough. Our secondary user felt indifferent towards recycling
        but does it out of convenience and peer pressure.

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Ideating">Ideating Potential Solutions</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Our ideation process started with us proposing "How Might We?"
        questions and dot-mapping which ones we felt best about.

      <img class="main-image" src="./affinity-map.png">

      <p class="main-paragraph">From there, we conducted a Crazy 8s sketching session and
        heat-mapped those as well. <span class="emphasized">My team took very well to my
          suggestions of a profile page and showing a user's reward status on the screen after

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Prototyping">Prototyping Final Solutions</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Before prototying, we constructed a sitemap and
        preliminary wireframes of our application.

      <!-- Design System Here -->
      <p class="main-paragraph">I then put everything together.
        As aforementioned, the two main actions I focused on were
        <strong class="emphasized">editing a message</strong>
        and <strong class="emphasized">viewing message edits</strong>. I made sure both processes
        involved
        similar steps to other message interactions to prevent unnecessarily increasing
        cognitive load.

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Testing">Testing Our Solutions</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">We conducted 5 <span class="emphasized">usability tests</span> through observation
          and interviewing, which ultimately taught us:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li class="list-item">
            Clear iconography is important.</span>
            3 of our participants thought our icons were confusing.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            User onboarding is highly valuable.</span>
            Participants expressed they would have been more comfortable
            navigating the application if they completed onboarding first.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="main-paragraph">The Rewards section of our app was well-received,
          as were the educational tips and recyclable product recommendations.
          Overall, test users appreciated the mission behind the app and said they
          would use it after further development.</p>

    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="section__title" id="Reflection">Reflecting</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">This project was an excellent exercise in utilizing the Design Thinking Framework, as
        well as applying principles of user interface design and working on a team. I particularly enjoyed conducting
        user research to gain insights about target users and contributing to a design system.
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Although the product will not move into a development phase, I believe the entire team
        gained valuable knowledge about young adults and our relationship to recycling.
