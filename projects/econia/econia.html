          Young adults are often confused about which products to recycle and
          how to recycle them due to the wide range of recyclable materials
          and recycling parameters. As such, recyclable waste ends up in landfills
          instead of recycling centers. </p>

      <h2 class="section__title">The Solution</h2>

      <p class="main-paragraph">My team and I utilized the Design Thinking Framework
        throughout the course of one semester to create a mobile application that would
        simultaneously educate users and incentivize them to recycle.
        As such, our process involved:</p>

        <li class="list-item emphasized">Prototyping Solutions</li>
        <li class="list-item emphasized">Testing Final Designs for Usability</li>
      </ol>

      <!-- Defining -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Defining">Defining the Product</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">To begin, our team conducted a competitive analysis
        on recycling apps and sites. We discovered that existing products are
        great at educating users and providing local resources, as well as having
        enjoyable user experiences. However, they are purely educational and lack
        incentives to motivate users to apply their recycling knowledge.
      </p>

      <!-- Empathizing -->
      <!-- Include: 
        5. Journey Map
      -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Empathizing">Empathizing With Target Users</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">We then moved on to gaining an understanding of our target users.
        We believed a user survey coupled with 5 interviews would give us the best insights.</p>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Our survey revealed:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item emphasized">71% of respondents reported
          having a very positive attitude towards recycling,
          but only 28% felt like their knowledge of recycling was extensive.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item emphasized">92% reported receiving no compensation for
          recycling, but a majority (69%) said they would recycle more if they
          received something in return.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item emphasized">Over half (57%) said they never pay attention to
          codes on products when recycling.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Our one-on-one interviews taught us that
        young adults are:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item emphasized">Often influenced by
          peer pressure to recycle more.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item emphasized">Enthusiastic about
          sustainable/reusable alternatives to products they commonly recycle.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item emphasized">Interested in lifestyle apps thar help them with
          their daily routines.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Using our competitor analysis and research, we decided it was
        imperative for our product to further educate users on recyclable products and the recycling process.
        We would also need to provide healthy peer pressure and relevant incentives for participating.
      </p>

      <p class="main-paragraph">
        From there, we completed empathy maps and personas for our 2 main types of users.
        Our primary user was a young adult who greatly favors recycling but believes the process
        is not streamlined enough. Our secondary user felt indifferent towards recycling
        but does it out of convenience and peer pressure.

      <p class="main-paragraph">Our ideation process started with us proposing "How Might We?"
        questions and dot-mapping which ones we felt best about.

      <img class="process-step__image-image" src="./affinity-map.png">

      <p class="main-paragraph">From there, we conducted a Crazy 8s sketching session and

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Prototyping">Prototyping Final Solutions</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Before prototying, we constructed a sitemap and

      <!-- Design System Here -->
      <p class="main-paragraph">I then put everything together.
        As aforementioned, the two main actions I focused on were
        <strong class="emphasized">editing a message</strong>
        and <strong class="emphasized">viewing message edits</strong>. I made sure both processes
        involved
        similar steps to other message interactions to prevent unnecessarily increasing
        cognitive load.

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Testing">Testing Our Solutions</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">I tested my solution with
          a few other Messages users and asked for their feedback.
          Generally, the response was positive, but they specifically
          liked:
          <strong class="emphasized">1. using a different color</strong> to delineate message types, and
          <strong class="emphasized">2. preserving the original message</strong> to help compare with
          the edited; keeping the original message would prevent users from
          concealing/erasing negative evidence (trash talking, explicit photos, etc).
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="section__title" id="Reflection">Reflecting</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">One of my next steps for this would be to optimize for accessibility.
        Some of my design decisions were rooted in the color of components, but many users may
        not be able to interpret them. As such, it would be beneficial to figure out
        how to convey the same ideas without relying on color.
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Overall, this was a great mini project to exercise my user interface
        design skills, as well as some fundamental user experience design concepts.
