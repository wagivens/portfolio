        Living sustainably is becoming increasingly important as the effects of climate change become more apparent.
        Young adults enjoy trying to live green, particularly by recycling, but the process can be confusing and the
        benefits are not always clear. This prompted a team of myself and 4 others, as part of my “Design for User
        Experience” course, to remedy those issues with a new digital product.

      <article class="problem-statement">
        <p class="problem-statement__text"><strong>Problem:</strong>
          Young adults are often confused about which products to recycle and
          how to recycle them due to the wide range of recyclable materials
          and recycling parameters. As such, recyclable waste ends up in landfills
          instead of recycling centers. </p>

          <p class="summary-paragraph">
            A team of myself and four others crafted a native mobile application focused on simplifying the recycling
            process for young adults while also educating them on sustainability and providing relevant incentives for
            living green.

      <h2 class="section__title">The Solution</h2>

      <p class="main-paragraph">My team and I utilized the Design Thinking Framework
        throughout the course of one semester to create a mobile application that would
        simultaneously educate users and incentivize them to recycle.
        As such, our process involved:</p>
      <ol class="list" id="project-timeline">
        <li class="list-item">Defining the Product</li>
        <li class="list-item">Empathizing With Target Users</li>

        <li class="list-item">Prototyping Solutions</li>
        <li class="list-item">Testing Final Designs for Usability</li>
      </ol>

      <!-- Defining -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Defining">Defining the Product</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">To begin, our team conducted a
        <span class="emphasized">competitive analysis</span>
        on recycling apps and sites. By comparing the features, strengths, and weaknesses of different products, we
        discovered that many recycling apps/sites are
        great at educating users and providing local resources, as well as having
        enjoyable user experiences. However, they are purely educational and lack
        incentives to motivate users to apply their recycling knowledge.
      </p>

        alt="Competitive matrix that was used to analyze the market.">

      <!-- Empathizing -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Empathizing">Empathizing With Target Users</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">We then moved on to gaining an understanding of our target users.
        We believed a <span class="emphasized">user survey</span>
        coupled with
        <span class="emphasized">five interviews</span> would give us the best insights.
      </p>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Our survey revealed:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">71% of respondents reported
          having a very positive attitude towards recycling,
          but only 28% felt like their knowledge of recycling was extensive.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">92% reported receiving no compensation for
          recycling, but a majority (69%) said they would recycle more if they
          received something in return.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">Over half (57%) said they never pay attention to
          codes on products when recycling.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Our one-on-one interviews taught us that
        young adults are:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="list-item">Often influenced by
          peer pressure to recycle more.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">Enthusiastic about
          sustainable/reusable alternatives to products they commonly recycle.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">Interested in lifestyle apps that help them with
          their daily routines.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Using our competitive analysis and research, we decided it was
        imperative for our product to further educate users on recyclable products and the recycling process.
        We would also need to provide healthy peer pressure and relevant incentives for participating.
      </p>

      <p class="main-paragraph">
        From there, we completed
        <span class="emphasized">empathy maps</span> and
        <span class="emphasized">personas</span> for our two main types of users.
        Our primary user was a young adult who greatly favors recycling but believes the process
        is not streamlined enough. Our secondary user felt indifferent towards recycling
        but does it out of convenience and peer pressure.

      <!-- Ideating -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Ideating">Ideating Potential Solutions</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Our ideation process started with us proposing
        <span class="emphasized">"How Might We?"</span>
        questions and dot-voting which ones we felt best about. Our most popular ones revolved around educating users,
        providing incentives, and integrating easily into users' lives.
      </p>

      <img class="main-image" src="./affinity-map.png" alt="Affinity map with dot mapping.">

      <p class="main-paragraph">From there, we conducted a Crazy 8s sketching session and
        dot-voted those as well. <span class="emphasized">My team took very well to my
          suggestions of a profile page and showing a user's reward status on the screen after
          they complete a recycle.
        </span>
      </p>

      <!-- Prototyping -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Prototyping">Prototyping Final Solutions</h3>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Before prototyping, we constructed a sitemap and
        preliminary wireframes of our application.
      </p>

      <img src="sitemap.png" alt="Econia sitemap" class="main-image">
      <img src="wireframe.png" alt="3 screens in the Econia wireframe file" class="main-image">

      <!-- Design System -->
      <p class="main-paragraph">We also put together a design system for consistent styling and rapid prototyping.
        Here are examples of our color palette, font, and logo.
      </p>

      <img class="main-image" src="./design-system-example.png" alt="">

      <p class="main-paragraph">Econia's color palette consisted mostly of blue and green Earth tones to represent
        freshness and nature. Our primary font, Roboto, was chosen because of its simplicity, and our logo incorporated
        a recycling icon to remind users of the product's purpose.
      </p>

      <!-- Hi-Fi Mockups -->
      <p class="main-paragraph">Then, we put everything together to create our high-fidelity mockups.
      </p>

          <h4 class="process-step__title">Scanning a Recyclable Product</h4>
          <p class="process-step__description">The Home page shows users how other users in their area are using the
            application. We thought presenting users with a list of other people's recycling achievements would promote
            healthy peer pressure.</p>

          <p class="process-step__description">Users would scan a recyclable item to start Econia's recycling process.
            They would earn a small number of points simply by scanning, after which they could save it to their list to
            recycle later (if they couldn't in the moment) or locate nearby bins to deposit the item.

            app, they are given a map of nearby recycling bins. Once they have arrived at a recycling bin, they scan a

            clothing discounts, restaurant coupons, etc), which users can buy with their recycling points.

      <!-- Testing -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Testing">Testing Our Solutions</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">We conducted 5 <span class="emphasized">usability tests</span> through observation
          and interviewing, which ultimately taught us:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li class="list-item">
            Clear iconography is important.</span>
            3 of our participants thought our icons were confusing.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            User onboarding is highly valuable.</span>
            Participants expressed they would have been more comfortable
            navigating the application if they completed onboarding first.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="main-paragraph">The Rewards section of our app was well-received,
          as were the educational tips and recyclable product recommendations.
          Overall, test users appreciated the mission behind the app and said they
          would use it after further development.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="section__title" id="Reflection">Reflecting</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">This project was an excellent exercise in the Design Thinking Framework, as
        well as applying principles of user interface design and working on a team. I particularly enjoyed conducting
        user research to gain insights about target users and contributing to a design system.
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Although the product will not move into a development phase, I believe the entire team
        gained valuable knowledge about young adults and our relationship to sustainability.
