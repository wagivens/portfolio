          Young adults are often confused about which products to recycle and
          how to recycle them due to the wide range of recyclable materials
          and recycling parameters. As such, recyclable waste ends up in landfills
          instead of recycling centers.
          <span class="emphasized">How might we streamline the recycling process for young adults while
            also educating them on the environmental impact of the products they use?</span>

      <h2 class="section__title">The Original Solution</h2>

      <p class="main-paragraph">My team and I utilized the Design Thinking Framework
        throughout the course of one semester to create a mobile application that would
        simultaneously educate users and incentivize them to recycle.</p>

      <!-- Research -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Research">Research</h3>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Before jumping into
        generative research, we thought about what questions we needed to answer
        (<strong>research objectives</strong>) and the best ways to answer them
        (<strong>research methods</strong>). We needed information about our
        market, as well as a mix of attitudinal and behavioral data about our target user group, so we focused on
        methods that would help us with that.</p>

      <div class="explanation-box">
        <p class="box-title">Our main research objectives were to:
        </p>
        <ul class="box-list">
          <li>Understand people's current recycling habits.</li>
          <li>Identify how recycling habits can be changed or improved.</li>
          <li>Examine people's knowledge of recycling materials.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="explanation-box">
        <p class="box-title">Some of the questions we would need to answer to reach those objectives:
        </p>
        <ul class="box-list">
          <li>How often do people recycle?</li>
          <li>How do people decide which items to recycle?</li>
          <li>What does the end-to-end process of recycling look like for most people?</li>
          <li>Do people care about sustainability in other areas (ex: reusable bags, low water usage)?</li>
          <li>Are people enrolled in any rewards programs (ex: Starbucks Rewards)? Why or why not?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="main-paragraph">We understood our data should be both qualitative and quantitative, so we decided on
        doing a <span class="emphasized">competitive analysis, user interviews, and a survey</span>. The competitive
        analysis would provide useful data
        about the market, while the interviews and survey would give us insight into our target users' behavior and
        attitudes.

        <p class="research-data">
          By comparing the features, strengths, and weaknesses of different products, we
          discovered that many <strong>recycling apps/sites are
            great at educating users and providing local resources, as well as having
            enjoyable user experiences. However, they are solely educational and lack
            gamification and incentives</strong> to motivate users to apply their recycling knowledge.

      <div class="research-finding">
        <p class="research-data">Our interviews gave us deeper attitudinal

          <strong>Young adults are: 1) often influenced by

        <p class="research-data"><strong>We spent time thoroughly analyzing our survey results.</strong>
          71% of respondents reported feeling positive towards recycling,
          but only 28% felt like their knowledge of recycling was extensive.
          92% reported receiving no compensation for recycling,
          and a majority (69%) said they would recycle more if they
          received something in return. Over half (57%) said they never
          pay attention to codes on products when recycling.</p>

        <ul class="box-list">
          <li>Our product needed to further educate users on
            recyclable products and the recycling process.</li>

            healthy peer pressure and relevant incentives for participating.</li>

      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Ideating">Ideating Potential Solutions</h3>

      <p class="main-paragraph">
        The first step we took in our ideation process was completing
        <span class="emphasized">empathy maps</span> for our two main types of users;
        this would let us put ourselves in the shoes of our users in a deeper way.
        Our primary user was a young adult who greatly favors recycling but believes the process
        is not streamlined enough. Our secondary user felt indifferent towards recycling
        but does it out of convenience and peer pressure.

      <p class="main-paragraph">We also proposed some
        <span class="emphasized">"How Might We?"</span>
        questions and dot-voting which themes were most common among us.
        <strong>Our most popular ones revolved around educating users,
          providing incentives, and integrating easily into users' lives,
          so we decided to explore those ideas further.</strong>

      <p class="main-paragraph">Before prototyping, we constructed a sitemap and
        wireframes of our application.

        <p class="box-title">Then, we put everything together to create our high-fidelity prototypes.
          Here is a brief breakdown of the key features:
        </p>
        <ul class="box-list">
          <li>The Home screen presents users with a list of other people's
            recycling activity to promote healthy peer pressure.</li>
          <li>People would start the recycling process by
            scanning a recyclable item, after which they could save it to their list to
            recycle later (if they couldn't in the moment) or locate nearby bins to deposit the item.</li>
          <li>To successfully complete a “recycle”,
            people are given a map of nearby recycling bins. Upon arriving, they scan a
            QR code (letting us know the item deposit was legitimate) and are then awarded points.</li>
          <li>Econia's Profile page shows users their points and suggests
            sustainable alternatives to products they recycle often (ex: water bottles).
            The Rewards page offers prizes relevant to our target audience,
            which users can buy with their recycling points.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Testing -->
      <h3 class="subsection__title" id="Testing">Testing Our Solutions</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">Our evaluative research centered around simply
          testing our prototype and determining if we addressed the
          pain points our target user group identified in our generative research.
          We decided the best method would be <strong>5 remote moderated
            usability tests conducted over Zoom and using our prototype on Figma.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="main-paragraph">To properly conduct our usability tests, we
          constructed a <strong>script</strong> that each team member would use when interviewing.
          The script would include <strong>scenarios</strong> involving important user flows, and
          we would be able to measure the effectiveness/intuitiveness of our solutions
          by how well our testers did with the scenarios.
        </p>

        <p class="main-paragraph">We <strong>debriefed with testers after
            each scenario</strong>, asking them questions about their experience (ex: "Did you
          expect for that to happen when you clicked there?", "What did you think that
          icon meant before clicking on it?").

    <!-- My Redesign -->
    <section class="case-study__section">
      <h2 class="section__title" id="Redesign">My Redesign</h2>
      <p class="main-paragraph">Since Econia was never intended to go into production, I decided to
        redesign it independently to see how I could improve it. I made many
        purely aesthetic modifications, but I based most other refinements
        on the experience as a whole.
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph">One change was
        <span class="emphasized">placing the user's points at the top</span>,
        making it always visible instead of only accessible on the
        Profile and Rewards pages. I also
        <span class="emphasized">moved the nav bar to the
          bottom of the screen</span> both for better ergonomics and to be more consistent with
        other applications (we, as users, are familiar with nav bars being at the bottom).

      <p class="main-paragraph">I made the
        <span class="emphasized">home screen more of a leaderboard</span> instead of
        a constant stream of activity from nearby users; the folks using
        the app likely would only want to see a total number of points, not
        every recycle another user is making. Additionally, I
        <span class="emphasized">refined the visual design of the List page</span>
        while retaining the ability for users to
        learn more about what they are recycling.
