            <p class="main-paragraph">
                I have never been able to travel outside of my home state,
                so I have a lot of places I want to visit.
                One day, I decided to start collating my trip ideas in Notion instead of
                trying to keep them all in my head;
                I listed out every location along with potential hotels to stay at,
                sites to see, and restaurants to dine at.

                It became a bit cumbersome to use. After a while, I thought,
                “This is probably how lots of people plan their trips,
                but there might be a cleaner, more streamlined way.”
                Thus, the task for me was to<span class="emphasized">create a simple, lightweight way
                    for people to organize their plans
                    for trips around the world</span>, and Chronacle was born.

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                In practice, you may not always have access to robust research and
                user insights before designing something new or iterating on a design.
                I wanted to challenge myself by designing something with ambiguous constraints;
                what does the design process look like with limited information about your
                target users and their motivations?

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                After examining the applications from the three competitors,
                I noted what I believed to be the most important user flows and features shared among them:

            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-item">A primary “Trip” page that presents the user with an overview of their trip,
                    as well as an itinerary section for users to organize their desired activities.</li>
                <li class="list-item">A section including suggested or popular activities in location,
                    allowing users to quickly add popular sites to their trip plans.</li>
                <li class="list-item">An “Explore” page for users to search for various things to do in a particular
                    location.</li>
                <li class="list-item">A page essentially giving an overview of a specific business or activity.
                    These pages typically include information such as a business's/activity's address,
                    phone number, and operating hours, as well as photos.</li>

                Of course, your first solution(s) are hardly ever your best,
                and there is always room to iterate and improve.
                Even after completing the high-fidelity designs for Chronacle,
                I noticed there were some elements of the product that could be refined.
