                Until 2023, I had never owned a passport;
                I had never even flown despite
                having many places I wanted to visit. For a few years,
                I used a spreadsheet in Notion to list destinations,
                sights, and interesting restaurants, but eventually,
                I decided I wanted a better way to plan my
                future trips; I imagined others might have as well, given the boom
                in travel following the COVID-19 pandemic.

                I saw that as an opportunity to grow and reinforce my
                design skills by creating a tool for myself and
                others to use. It is named Chronacle since it is
                meant to help you chronicle your journeys around the world.

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                As the sole designer for Chronacle, I needed
                to be crafty when conducting research;
                <span class="emphasized">in addition
                    to doing heuristic analyses on existing travel aggregators
                    (Expedia, TripAdvisor, etc), a large part of my generative
                    research involved leveraging data from a 2021 study by
                    market research leader Mintel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Of the 1,300+ travelers surveyed in the study,
                <span class="emphasized">people overwhelmingly booked reservations through
                    their preferred brand's platforms</span>, with 76% using
                a brand's website or mobile app (ex: Marriott Hotels)
                vs. an aggregator. The study mentions
                <span class="emphasized">travel
                    aggregators are “most competitive in activities booking,”
                    not accommodations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Mintel also discovered folks are taking fewer,
                shorter trips post-pandemic, only traveling to familiar
                places, and booking accommodations mere
                days / weeks before leaving.
                <span class="emphasized">Travelers need helpful
                    starting points when going somewhere new and
                    want ideas for things to do.</span>

                        alt="Screenshot of my research document. This part of the document includes a list of research questions I wanted to answer during my generative research phase of designing Chronacle. Some questions are highlighted to indicate priority, such as, 'How far in advance are people planning their trips?,' 'What is the average length of people's trips?,' 'Where are people making trips to?,' and 'How many trips are people planning each year?.'">

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                <span class="emphasized">I decided Chronacle would not handle
                    things like flight reservations,
                    hotel accommodations, car rentals, etc.</span>
                The reduced scope is better for
                engineering purposes (no need to integrate
                various airline/hotel platforms), but
                users also get a more focused and
                predictable experience with
                fewer potential failure points.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Ultimately, the focus for Chronacle would be
                <span class="emphasized">simply
                    helping people check out places they're interested in</span>
                and save activities / experiences they want
                to make plans for (ex: shopping, places in nature, landmarks, etc).
