                Up until 2023, I had never owned a passport;
                I had never flown (especially internationally) despite
                having many places I wanted to visit. For a couple years,
                I used a spreadsheet in Notion to list destinations,
                sights, and interesting restaurants, but eventually,
                I decided that I wanted a better way to plan my
                future trips; I imagined others did too, especially
                given the boom in travel following the COVID-19 pandemic.

                I saw that as an opportunity to grow and reinforce my
                design skills by creating a tool for myself and
                others to use. It is named Chronacle since it is
                meant to help you chronicle your journeys around the world.

At the bottom of the modal, there is a greyed-out, disabled button that says 'Let's Go' with an accompanying greyed-out icon of a thumbs up.">

                Generative research
                using market data from Mintel showed me folks are taking fewer,
                shorter trips post-pandemic and only traveling to familiar places.
                Travelers are reluctant to visit new places but need helpful
                starting points when they do go somewhere new; they want to see
                as many options as possible for things to do.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                People plan trips mere days or weeks before leaving,
                and <span class="emphasized">use their preferred brands' sites (ex: Marriott Hotels)
                    to book accommodations</span> like hotels/flights/rental cars instead
                of using travel agency sites (ex: TripAdvisor).

                        alt="Screenshot of my research document. This part of the document includes a list of research questions I wanted to answer during my generative research phase of designing Chronacle. Some questions are highlighted to indicate priority, such as, 'How far in advance are people planning their trips?,' 'What is the average length of people's trips?,' 'Where are people making trips to?,' and 'How many trips are people planning each year?.'">
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                As such, I decided that unlike the trip planning apps I
                tested when doing heuristic analyses,
                <span class="emphasized">Chronacle would not
                    handle things like flights, hotel reservations,
                    car rentals, etc.</span> Not only is the reduced scope better for
                engineering purposes, but users get a much more focused
                and predictable experience with fewer potential failure points.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                I figured the focus for Chronacle should be on
                activities and experiences you might not reserve
                in advance, but still want to make plans for.
