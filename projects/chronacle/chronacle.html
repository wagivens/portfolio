            <h3 class="subsection__title">Trip Planning on Notion</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                I have never been able to travel outside of my home state,
                so I have a lot of places I want to visit.
                One day, I decided to start collating my trip ideas in Notion instead of
                trying to keep them all in my head;
                I listed out every location along with potential hotels to stay at,
                sites to see, and restaurants to dine at.
            </p>
            <article class="idea-box">
                <div class="idea-box__img-container">
                    <img src="./notion-planning.png" alt="Two screenshots of a Notion page.
                  One screenshot has city names on it, and the other has names of restaurants in
                  the city.">

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                It became a bit cumbersome to use. After a while, I thought,
                “This is probably how lots of people plan their trips,
                but there might be a cleaner, more streamlined way.”
                Thus, the task for me was to<span class="emphasized"> create a simple, lightweight way
                    for people to organize their plans
                    for trips around the world</span>, and Chronacle was born.

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                In practice, you may not always have access to robust research and
                user insights before designing something new or iterating on a design.
                <span class="emphasized">I wanted to challenge myself by designing something with ambiguous
                    constraints;</span>
                what does the design process look like with limited information about your
                target users and their motivations?
            </p>
            <h3 class="subsection__title">User Interview</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                At this point in the design process, you're likely
                conducting interviews with folks you think are part
                of your target user group. I decided I would do a short
                interview with only one person to discover more about
                their trip-planning process. This person:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-item">Looks through trip planning applications (ex: TripAdvisor) beforehand for
                    activities they can do while there.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Considers the cost and safety of each activity, as well as the reviews.
                    Reputation is important for places they have never been to.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Tends to save plans (ex: sites they want to see) to their phone or a note-taking
                    application online (like Notion).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                These insights were great, but obviously not enough. I decided to also complete a competitive analysis,
                reviewing applications from competitors (Trip Advisor, Wanderlog, and TripScout) and analyzing their
                features/user flows.

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                After examining the applications from the three competitors,
                I noted what I believed to be the most important user flows and features shared among them:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-item">A primary “Trip” page that presents the user with an overview of their trip,
                    as well as an itinerary section for users to organize their desired activities.</li>
                <li class="list-item">A section including suggested or popular activities in location,
                    allowing users to quickly add popular sites to their trip plans.</li>
                <li class="list-item">An “Explore” page for users to search for various things to do in a particular
                    location.</li>
                <li class="list-item">A page essentially giving an overview of a specific business or activity.
                    These pages typically include information such as a business's/activity's address,
                    phone number, and operating hours, as well as photos.</li>
            </ul>

                These four flows were what I decided to primarily focus on
                for Chronacle.

                Of course, your first solution(s) are hardly ever your best,
                and there is always room to iterate and improve.
                Even after completing the high-fidelity designs for Chronacle,
                I noticed there were some elements of the product that could be refined.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Here is what I changed:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-item">For the main Trip page, I refined the itinerary date list to be cleaner, changed
                    the activity rating to be more consistent with the Explore page, and moved all activity actions into
                    their own menu.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Within the Explore page, I made use of breadcrumbs instead of buttons. This lets
                    the user know how far into the Explore section they are and provides easy backtracking.</li>
                <li class="list-item">When a user is searching for activities, results are segmented using pagination. I
                    decided on this instead of a “load more” button so users can know which page they found certain
                    activities on.</li>

            <p class="main-paragraph">Now that the designs for Chronacle are finished, my next tasks will be:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-item"><span class="emphasized">Usability testing.</span> This is of utmost importance
                    since I can learn the most about
                    my current designs by simply testing them, allowing me to iterate as needed.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Putting together a <span class="emphasized">design system in Storybook.</span>
                    Using Storybook to create a design
                    system will allow me to have a single source of truth for various aspects of the product (visual,
                    layout, components, etc).</li>
                <li class="list-item">Development.
                    I'm excited to make use of <span class="emphasized">Design Tokens and Web Components</span>
                    when developing Chronacle.
                    <span class="emphasized">Design Tokens</span> will allow me to easily incorporate design
                    decisions into my development workflow;
                    I'll only have to change design decisions in one place
                    and it will cascade through the entire design system/product.
                    <span class="emphasized">Web Components</span> are an exciting addition to the JavaScript language,
                    and tooling for them is growing as they become more popular.
                    I will specifically be using the Lit framework to develop Chronacle's components.
