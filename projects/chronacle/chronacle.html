            <p class="main-paragraph">
                I have never been able to travel outside of my home state,
                so I have a lot of places I want to visit.
                One day, I decided to start collating my trip ideas in Notion instead of
                trying to keep them all in my head;
                I listed out every location along with potential hotels to stay at,
                sites to see, and restaurants to dine at.

                It became a bit cumbersome to use. After a while, I thought,
                “This is probably how lots of people plan their trips,
                but there might be a cleaner, more streamlined way.”
                Thus, the task for me was to<span class="emphasized"> create a simple, lightweight way
                    for people to organize their plans
                    for trips around the world</span>, and Chronacle was born.

                In this stage of early, generative research,
                <span class="emphasized">I mostly focused on attitudinal methods and analyzing how people feel about
                    trip planning and their
                    resulting trips</span>;
                I thought this would give me a great sense of what
                people care about when planning trips and their
                reception to existing tools. Also, <span class="emphasized">behavioral methods would
                    have been impractical</span> because I wasn't able
                to observe people while they were planning or taking their trips.

            <h3 class="subsection__title">Secondary Research</h3>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                As the sole designer, I figured I could first
                <span class="emphasized">leverage some secondary research from a reputable consumer
                    research organization like Mintel</span>. This gave me the attitudinal data I was looking for, but
                also
                insights into people's behavior regarding their trips. Here's what I learned:
            </p>
            <!-- Research Findings -->
            <div class="research-finding">
                <p class="research-data">
                    <strong>People are taking fewer trips post-pandemic, and trips are shorter.</strong>
                    Most people planned to take between 1 and 3 trips throughout 2021, and nearly half of the people
                    surveyed
                    (46%) planned for trips to be between 1 and 3 days long. The next largest group (38%)
                    planned for their trips to be between 4 and 7 days. Lower-income households (less than $75k income)
                    had shorter trips, only
                    planning for trips between 1 and 3 days.
                </p>
                <p class="research-takeaway">My Takeaway: The small number of trips and the limited time spent away
                    might mean people will want to maximize their trip schedules. Also, since lower-income homes are
                    staying for shorter periods, they will need to be able to easily see the cost of food and
                    activities, and maybe even the average time activities require</p>
            </div>
            <div class="research-finding">
                <p class="research-data">
                    <strong>Folks are staying in their countries and taking vacations to familiar places</strong>;
                    68% of people surveyed said recent trips were to visit family, and 58% said trips were to elsewhere
                    in the U.S. Only 17% went somewhere new, and even fewer (13%) to a place outside of the U.S.
                </p>
                <p class="research-takeaway">My Takeaway: People are reluctant to visit places they know nothing about,
                    so I could give suggestions for things like landmarks, restaurants, and entertainment instead of
                    leaving them to find and list things out. This gives them some pre-trip comfort and allows them to
                    freely change plans without consequence</p>
            </div>
            <div class="research-finding">
                <p class="research-data">
                    <strong>People are increasingly using their mobile devices to plan trips, and are increasingly
                        booking accommodations through brand apps instead of online travel agencies like TripAdvisor.
                        They are more likely to use online travel agencies for activities instead of for
                        accommodations.</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="research-takeaway">My Takeaway: I don't need to focus on providing ways to book accommodations
                    like hotels, flights, rental cars, etc. since people will use their preferred brands' apps to do so.
                    Chronacle should focus on activities/experiences you can't reserve in advance and things you
                    wouldn't reserve on an app, such as restaurant reservations</p>
            </div>
            <div class="research-finding">
                <p class="research-data">
                    <strong>People want flexibility in their trips.</strong> 53% of people surveyed wanted travel
                    booking apps to show lower-cost alternatives to their dates and times. The same amount of people
                    said they wanted a flexible booking calendar. Safety ratings and personalizations were desired
                    features as well, with 36% and 31% of people saying they wanted them, respectively.
                </p>
                <p class="research-takeaway">My Takeaway: People care about flexibility and cost, so Chronacle should
                    provide the price
                    of activities, entertainment, food, etc. and present all options. It should also give people a sense
                    of freedom by allowing them to freely add, remove, and rearrange the things they add to their trip.
                    Since personalization is important, Chronacle should let people both search for things they want to
                    see/do as well as add them to a personal “trip” they can keep referencing and changing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="research-finding">
                <p class="research-data">
                    <strong>People are planning closer to trip dates--sometimes not until days or weeks beforehand--to
                        take advantage of deals and discounts. However, things like flights and hotels are often first
                        booked about a month in advance.</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="research-takeaway">My Takeaway: This is more evidence that flexibility is very important for
                    people when planning trips. Chronacle should aim to allow as much freedom and flexibility for users
                    as possible</p>

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                The Mintel study gave insight into which platforms people are using to outline their trips, so <span
                    class="emphasized">I used
                    that information to conduct a competitive analysis</span>; I was able to pinpoint common features

                focused on particular heuristics like Flexibility and Efficiency since
                they directly related to my secondary research findings.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                <span class="emphasized">The four key players in this space are Booking
                    Holdings (creator of

                products are
                more centered on accommodations, I decided to review Expedia and TripAdvisor's products along with other
                direct competitors TripScout and Wanderlog.

                    <li>A page essentially giving an overview of a specific business or activity.

                Of course, your first solution(s) are hardly ever your best,
                and there is always room to iterate and improve.
                Even after completing the high-fidelity designs for Chronacle,

                        I'm excited to make use of <span class="emphasized">Design Tokens and Web Components</span>
                        when developing Chronacle.
                        <span class="emphasized">Design Tokens</span> will allow me to easily incorporate design
                        decisions into my development workflow;
                        I'll only have to change design decisions in one place
                        and it will cascade through the entire design system/product.
                        <span class="emphasized">Web Components</span> are an exciting addition to the JavaScript
                        language,
                        and tooling for them is growing as they become more popular.
                        I will specifically be using the Lit framework to develop Chronacle's components.
