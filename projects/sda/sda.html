                As a Design Intern at Snap Inc.,
                I worked cross-functionally with two other designers,
                engineers, and marketers to imagine a Snapchat feature
                addressing the unique challenges faced by underprivileged
                teens and young adults in their academic journeys.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                One core discovery through early research was that
                underprivileged students in high school and college are five
                times more likely to drop out than their higher-income peers.
                Given that information, our primary focus for our feature was,
                <span class="emphasized">“How might we provide under-resourced students the tools and
                    structure they need to succeed?”</span>
            </p>

                        alt="Slide that is titled 'Problem.' Underneath that, there is a sentence that says, 'Low-income students are 5 times more likely to drop out than higher-income peers.' To the right, there is a Bitmoji that is saying, 'I'm lost.'"

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Early on, we had ideas about how to leverage Snapchat's
                existing functionalities; some of them included
                masterclasses on Snapchat's Spotlight page
                (their short-form video feature), interactive quizzes using
                Snapchat's AR filters, or something resembling Duolingo
                within Stories. Ultimately, we decided the most relevant
                product areas for our features were My AI and Chat/Group Chat.

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Our goals were to help foster a sense of
                accountability in teen and young adult students,
                but also provide some structure and guidance for
                students who are more likely to really need them;
                our answer was two features: AchieveAI and Pods.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                <span class="emphasized">The first feature, AchieveAI, leverages Snap's
                    MyAI chatbot released in early 2023 and is meant
                    to give under-resourced students targeted, individual
                    guidance in the form of an AI mentor.</span> Achieve AI
                helps provide the knowledge or motivation students
                need when navigating the college application process,
                or once they've actually entered a college environment.
                Snapchatters can use Achieve AI to do things like
                build a study schedule, set studying timers for
                themselves, or jump into a pod to study with their friends.

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                <span class="emphasized">Pods, our second feature, are dedicated groups within Snapchat
                    meant to serve as virtual study sessions for students who want
                    to collaborate with friends remotely.</span> Research into academic
                performance and long-term goal setting (such as diet and workout plans)
                showed us people are 95% more likely to be successful when they
                commit to something within a group setting.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">
                We made sure not to lose focus of Snapchat's
                primary vehicle for communication: the camera.
                Pods would utilize all of Snapchat's exhaustive text and
                chat functionality, but would also incorporate video
                chatting for (virtual) face-to-face interactions.
