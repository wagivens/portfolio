                <p class="white">The idea for this project came from a prompt on 
                    Designercize that focused on musicophiles searching for live events. Immediately, 
                    I went to work on designing a few screens.</p>

                <p class="white">When I finished, something did not feel right.
                    I thought the user interface felt amateur and rushed (even though these prompts 
                    <i>are</i> typically meant for quick ideation and prototyping).</p>
                <p class="white">So I decided that I would redo things, and that I 
                    would just create an entirely new product/application 
                    instead of only a couple of screens; I would use it as an opportunity to genuinely
                    practice my user interface design skills.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Project Summary</h2>
                <p class="white">My goal for this project was to simply create a visually attractive,
                    intuitive interface. My process was more condensed than it would be for 
                    a larger, established product. Three separate phases covered Project Definition,
                    Ideation, and Prototyping, eventually culminating in a finished mockup.</p>

            <section class="case-study-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Phase 1: Defining</h2>
                <p class="white">I began the project by doing a simple competitive analysis to better define the 
                    product parameters. At the moment, Ticketmaster and AXS Tickets are the frontrunners in live event ticketing; 
                    StubHub and SeatGeek are of similar popularity among ticket resellers. I downloaded their applications 
                    and studied their user flows and interactions as I went through them.</p>
                <p class="white">Of course, there was no single competitor that had every 
                    aspect I believed was most beneficial for users. Still, I noted elements and features from 
                    each application that made navigating through them easy for me: large banners for trending events,
                    letting users view events by category, and a header on the home page which
                    featured a search bar and results filters.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Phase 2: Ideation</h2>
                <p class="white">Next was a product feature/screen roadmap. I usually like to outline 
                    which elements I think should be on each screen, but with minimal sketching. This prevents
                    me from getting stuck when actually sketching.

                </figure>
                <p class="white">I then actually sketched out how I thought each screen should look based on 
                    my outlines:</p>

                <p class="white">
                    I wanted minimal color for this product to avoid complicating the user interface. Of course, 
                    there are neutral Grays and Whites for backgrounds, elements, and some text. I settled 
                    on #59A9F5 as Tixby's primary color based on color psychology; blue usually 
                    represents trustworthiness and comfort, and those are both important qualities for a ticket-buying platform.
